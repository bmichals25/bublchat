# Lip-Sync Features Implementation

## Overview

We've implemented a comprehensive lip-sync system that uses ElevenLabs' detailed phoneme metadata to animate character mouth positions in sync with text-to-speech audio. This enables a more immersive and engaging communication experience in the application.

## Components Created

1. **VisemeMapper Utility**
   - Maps ElevenLabs phonemes to standard visemes (mouth positions)
   - Supports 13 distinct viseme positions
   - Creates timing sequences for smooth animation

2. **CharacterAvatar Component**
   - Displays the character with animated mouth movements
   - Synchronizes animation with audio playback
   - Supports custom character visuals through image assets
   - Includes debugging visualization in development mode

3. **LipSync Component**
   - Combines CharacterAvatar with ProgressiveText
   - Provides a complete lip-sync experience with synchronized text
   - Manages audio playback state and completion events

4. **Enhanced TTS Integration**
   - Updated the TTS utility to request detailed phoneme metadata
   - Implements fallback mechanisms for when detailed data isn't available
   - Processes metadata into a format usable by the lip-sync system

5. **Character Asset Structure**
   - Defined a standardized directory structure for character assets
   - Created placeholder files and documentation for viseme images
   - Provided utilities for managing multiple characters

6. **MessageItem Integration**
   - Updated the MessageItem component to use the lip-sync feature
   - Seamlessly integrates with the existing chat interface

## Technical Implementation Details

1. **Phoneme Processing Pipeline**
   - ElevenLabs API request → Detailed metadata → Phoneme extraction → Viseme mapping → Animation

2. **Animation Approach**
   - Uses discrete viseme images for each mouth position
   - Updates based on precise timing from ElevenLabs metadata
   - Includes fallback for when detailed metadata isn't available

3. **Character Asset System**
   - Supports multiple characters through a flexible asset structure
   - Character images are loaded dynamically based on the current viseme
   - Provides appropriate fallbacks when assets are missing

## Usage Requirements

1. **API Requirements**
   - Valid ElevenLabs API key
   - Access to detailed metadata endpoints
   - Voice selection that supports phoneme data

2. **Asset Requirements**
   - Character images for each viseme position
   - Correctly named and placed in the required directory structure
   - Images should be PNG format with transparency

## Next Steps and Future Enhancements

1. **Advanced Animation**
   - Implement smoother transitions between visemes
   - Add support for more nuanced mouth movements
   - Include facial expressions based on sentiment

2. **Character Management**
   - Add UI for character selection and customization
   - Support for uploading custom character assets
   - Preview character animations

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Pre-load character assets for faster animation
   - Optimize the animation loop for smoother playback
   - Add support for different detail levels based on device performance
