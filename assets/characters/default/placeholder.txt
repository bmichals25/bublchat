Place your character images here:

1. base.png - Character with eyes open
   This should show the full character with a neutral expression and eyes open.

2. blink.png - Character with eyes closed
   This should be identical to base.png but with the character's eyes closed.

Both images should be PNG files with transparency and should have the same dimensions as your viseme images in the visemes/ directory.

The mouth region in these images will be overlaid with the appropriate viseme mouth shape during speech.

See the README.md in the parent directory for more details.
